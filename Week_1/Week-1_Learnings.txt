Week 1 – Python Learning Documentation

Day 1

* Studied the fundamentals of Python, including the origin of Python, common use cases, and widely used development tools.

* Practiced basic Python programs such as arithmetic operations and function calls.

* Learned the LEGB rule (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) to understand Python’s variable scope and name resolution.

* Understood that Python follows an indentation-based syntax, where indentation defines code blocks instead of braces.

Day 2

* Again learnt few conditions statements, input function, loop function and string manipulations

* Worked out the functions in the real world examples like uber, zomato and amazon sites, just the basic things.

Day 3

* Studied object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts including classes, objects, attributes, and methods.

* Practiced creating and instantiating classes with constructors and instance variables.

* Learned about inheritance and polymorphism for code reusability and extensibility.

* Explored encapsulation and access modifiers (public, private, protected) for data hiding.

Day 4

* Studied exception handling using try, except, and finally blocks to manage errors gracefully.

* Learned about built-in exceptions and how to create custom exceptions for specific error scenarios.

* Practiced file handling operations including reading, writing, and appending to files.

* Explored working with different file formats such as text files, CSV, and JSON for data persistence.


Day 5

* Studied Inheritance and its types

* Created a constructor and class object by basic examples

Day 6

* Studied Polymorphism and access specifiers  and access methods

Day 7

* Studied about encapsulation and class, instance, method 

* File managment for files to read and write, append file text
