# Week 2 Learnings

## Day 8
### Topic
Exception Handling and File Handling

### Key Concepts
- `try-except` blocks for handling runtime errors
- Common exception types (`ZeroDivisionError`, `FileNotFoundError`)
- File operations: read, write, append
- CSV file handling
- Intro to MySQL connectivity using `pymysql`

### Practice Done
- Built exception-handling programs for safer execution
- Read from `input.csv` and wrote to `output.csv`
- Created a MySQL connection setup script

### Notes
- Learned to handle failures without crashing the program.
- Understood how file I/O supports basic data processing.

## Day 9
### Topic
Higher-Order Functions (HOF)

### Key Concepts
- Functions passed as arguments
- Functions used as reusable behavior units
- Functional-style code reuse

### Practice Done
- Implemented `build_email(username, email_func)`
- Passed provider functions for Gmail, Ymail, and Hotmail formats

### Notes
- Improved understanding of functions as first-class objects.
- Learned how HOF makes code modular and flexible.

## Day 10
### Topic
Environment Setup

### Key Concepts
- Installed Anaconda and dependencies
- Created a virtual environment
- Prepared local system for Python practice

### Notes
- Setup is now ready for consistent learning and package management.

## Day 11
### Topic
Python Basics Practice

### Key Concepts
- Syntax and semantics
- Variables and data types
- Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
- Conditional statements and basic problem solving

### Practice Done
- Hello world and input/output programs
- Positive/negative/zero checks
- Largest of three numbers
- Factorial using loop
- Type checking and variable swapping
- Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion
- Even/odd and leap year checks
- String reverse and palindrome check
- Sorting a list

### Notes
- Completed a full basics assignment notebook for core Python foundations.

## Day 12
### Topic
Control Flow (Conditionals and Loops)

### Key Concepts
- `if`, `if-else`, `if-elif-else`, nested `if`
- `for` and `while` loops
- Nested loops
- `break`, `continue`, `pass`
- Combining conditions with loops

### Practice Done
- Number sign and parity programs
- Range printing and 5x5 star pattern
- Sum until sentinel input (`0`)
- Even numbers up to `n`
- Factorial and sum of digits
- Prime number check
- Fibonacci sequence generation

### Notes
- Built strong control-flow logic through multiple assignments.

## Day 13
### Topic
Lists and List Comprehensions

### Key Concepts
- List creation, access, slicing, update
- List methods: `append`, `insert`, `remove`, `pop`, `sort`, `reverse`, `clear`
- Iteration with `for` and `enumerate`
- List comprehensions (basic, conditional, nested)
- Nested lists and list of dictionaries

### Practice Done
- Created first 20 integers and accessed key positions
- Performed slicing on different ranges
- Generated squares and filtered even numbers
- Sorted values and removed duplicates
- Worked with matrix-style nested lists
- Built and sorted student score dictionaries

### Notes
- Improved speed and clarity in list-based data handling.

## Day 14
### Topic
Tuples

### Key Concepts
- Tuple creation (empty, mixed, nested)
- Indexing and slicing tuples
- Tuple operations (concatenation, repetition)
- Immutability of tuples
- Tuple methods: `count`, `index`
- Packing and unpacking (including starred unpacking)
- Iteration through nested tuples

### Practice Done
- Built tuple examples and combined tuple values
- Compared mutable lists vs immutable tuples
- Used unpacking patterns for cleaner code
- Iterated over nested tuple structures

### Notes
- Learned where tuples are better than lists for fixed, read-only data.
